    the Company come from the legal field. The idea of providing trademark 
    registration service through the internet is first suggested by one of our 
    founders Miss S. W. Wong who is a lawyer and the senior partner of S.W. Wong 
    &amp; Associates, a Hong Kong law firm. With 
    many years of experience in the field of trademark registration, she believes that 
    internet will not only make the service more easily accessible to the public but will also 
    make it more cost-effective for end users. It is against such a background that this 
    website is set up. It is our desire to provide the same standard of service as provided by 
    law firm, but in a more cost-effective manner.</font><p><font face="Arial" size="2"><font
    color="#000080">Our mission is to provide our customers with top-level service relating or 
    incidental to trademark registration. We strive to ensure that our services are of the 
    highest standard. As it is our aim to provide such service through the website with a 
    personal touch,</font> <font color="#000080">we welcome all <a style="color: rgb(0,0,128)"
