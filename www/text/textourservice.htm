    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">What is considered as a trademark in law?</font></small></b></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">A trademark is a mark that is used to promote 
    and identify the owner</font><font color="#000080">'</font><font face="Arial" color="#000080">s goods or services and to enable the public to distinguish them from the 
    goods or services of other traders. It may be a logo or device, name, signature, word, 
    letter, numeral, smell, figurative elements or combination of colors and 
    includes any combination of such signs and 3-dimensional shapes provided 
    that it must be represented in a form which can be recorded and published, 
    such as by way of drawing or description.<br>

    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Benefits of Registration of a Trademark</font></small></b></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Registration of a trademark will give the 
    owner of a trademark the right to prevent third parties from using his mark, or a 
    deceptively similar mark, without his consent for the goods or services for which it is 
    registered or for similar goods or services. For unregistered trademarks, owners have to 
    rely on common law for protection. It is more difficult to establish one</font><font color="#000080">'</font><font face="Arial" color="#000080">s case under common law. </font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">What trademark can be registered?</font></small></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><small>A trademark can be registered if it is:-</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>1. the name of a company, individual or firm represented in a</small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; special manner;</small><br>
    <small>2. the signature (except in Chinese characters) of the applicant;</small><br>
    <small>3. an invented word;</small><br>
    <small>4. a word that is not either descriptive of the goods or services</small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for which the trademark is used or is not a geographical</small><br>
    <small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name or is not a surname; or </small><br>
    <small>5. any other distinctive mark.</small></font></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Validity period of registration</font></small></p>
    </b><p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><small>A trademark when registered will last for 
    a period of 10 years and can be renewed indefinitely for successive periods of 
    10 years.</small></font></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">Procedure</font></small></p>
    </b><p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">It is advisable to do a 
    trademark search before filing the application to ensure that no similar 
    trademark has been registered. It takes about 2 months for the Trademark 
    Registry to respond to an application. If the Trademark Registry approves 
    the application, advertisement has to be placed in the Trademark Journal to 
    see if any third party will raise any objection. If no objection is raised 
    within 3 months, the application will proceed to registration. The effective date of the registration will be back dated to 
    the date of the application.</font></small></p>
    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">However, if the Trademark Registry does not 
    approve the application and raise objections, it is possible to raise counter objections 
    and persuade the Trademark Registry to withdraw their objections. Discussing these 
    objections and counter objections will take considerable time. The application in such 
    situation will take more than 6 months.</font></small></p>

    <p><small><font face="Arial" color="#000080">TRADEMARK REGISTRATION IN CHINA </font></small></b></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><small>The trademark application procedure is more 
    or less the same in China. We therefore have not set out separately the relevant 
    procedures herein. Should you have any query please do not hesitate to contact us.</small><br>
    <br>
    <small>Please note that there is one important difference between China &amp; Hong Kong 
    regarding trademark protection.&nbsp; China places great emphasis on registration and only 
    those who have registered their trademarks will be given protection.&nbsp; Whereas in Hong 
    Kong unregistered trademark still have protection under common law, even though it is more 
    difficult to establish to one's case under common law.&nbsp; In China, the first who 
    registers a trademark will have priority in claiming ownership of the trademark.&nbsp; It 
    is therefore&nbsp;always advisable to register your trademark in China in order to secure 
    priority and ownership of the trademark.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#000080"><small>We are pleased to provide registration 
    information for other countries upon request.</small></font></p>
